## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.
- Access to an SMTP server or an email service provider.

### Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

Configure the necessary environment variables for the microservice to operate, including email server credentials and specific environment variables (e.g., EMAIL_ROOT, etc.).

### Running

To start the microservice, execute:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### Usage

#### Sending Emails

To send an email, utilize the sendMail method provided by the service. This method allows for a flexible email composition, accommodating various elements such as recipients, subject, and body of the message. Additionally, it supports sending an HTML file as the email body, enabling rich text formatting and embedded images.

#### Required Data

- Subject (subject): The subject line of the email.
- To (to): The primary recipient(s) of the email. Multiple - recipients can be separated by commas.
- Message Body (message): The main content of the email. This can be either plain text (text) or an HTML file (file).

#### Optional Data

- From (from): The email address of the sender. If not specified, a default address will be used.
- CC (cc): Carbon copy recipients. Multiple recipients can be separated by commas.
- BCC (bcc): Blind carbon copy recipients. Multiple recipients can be separated by commas.

#### Message Composition

The EmailBodyMessage class allows for specifying the content of your email's body. You have the option to include either plain text or an HTML file:

- Text (text): Use this property to send a plain text message.
  Example
- File: you can send html files in string format or a buffer.
  - (socketFile): This file is exclusive when using queues directly
  - (file): Exclusive to http requests, you can send buffer type files

To send an email with both text and HTML options available, construct your message as follows:

```json
{
  "from": {
    "email": "from@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe"
  },
  "emailBody": {
    "subject": "Your Subject Here",
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "cc": "cc@example.com",
    "bcc": "bcc@example.com",
    "message": {
      "text": "This is a plain text message for email clients that do not support HTML."
    }
  }
}
```

### Subscribing Applications

To subscribe a new application and obtain a clientId and secretKey, use the subscribeApplication method. These credentials will allow the application to authenticate and use the provided services.

### Steps to Use the Application

#### Access to Queue Broker

- The application that wishes to use the messaging services must have access to the queue broker.
- To obtain access, please contact technical support.

#### Integration and Registration with CLARISA

- Once you have access to the broker, the application must request integration and registration with the CLARISA database.
- This should also be done by contacting technical support.

#### Registering the Application with the Microservice

With the application identification provided by CLARISA (consisting of an acronym: string and an environment: string), register your application with the microservice using the following endpoint:

- Endpoint: /api/email/subscribe-application
- Method: POST
- Request Body:

```json
{
  "acronym": "string",
  "environment": "string"
}
```

This registration will return the credentials needed to use the microservice.

#### Alternative Registration via Queue Broker

- If HTTP requests are not enabled on the server, registration can be done via the broker in the messages_queue queue and the subscribe-application pattern.
- The request body will be the same as the HTTP request.
  This registration will return a secret and a client_id, which will be required to use the messaging service.

#### HTTP Requests

HTTP requests must include an auth header with username and password:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string"
  }
}
```

#### Broker Requests

When using the broker, the message must consist of data and auth. The data depends on the service being used, and the auth should have the same format as the HTTP header:

```json
{
  "data": {
    // service-specific data
  },
  "auth": {
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string"
  }
}
```
